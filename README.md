![alt text](https://github.com/Brackly/Zindi-Swahili-News-Classification-Model/blob/main/Transformer.jpg)

This repo contains code on how to take a BERT based model already trained on Swahili, and finetune it to classify swahili text into 5 categories:
1. Kimataifa(International news),
2. Kitaifa(Local News),
3. Michezo(sports)
4. Burudani(Entertainment)
5. Biashara(Business)
   
Given a paragraph in Swahili, the model should classify the content into one of the aforementioned classes. 
Check out This article that explores the first part of this process i.e. Preprocessing the text before feeding it into a model for training
and which deals with the model initialization and training.
